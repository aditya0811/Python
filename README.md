The file is all about using while loops,if-else statements,for loops;declaring functions,working with dictionaries,adding 2d array numbers,converting 2d array to (array and tuple),converting dictionaries to (tuple and array),whether input is integer or not,methods on stringslike merging,sorting,deleting,slicing.list(tuples) to tuples(list),File input and output-to search a word in file,replace it,methods in dictionaries,copying objects

Some problems solved:-

 <li>Slicing a string </li>
  <li>Joyner</li>
  <li>Sorting list</li>
  <li>Splitting strings</li>
  <li>Binary Search</li>
  <li>Merge Sort</li>
